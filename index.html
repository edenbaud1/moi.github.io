                <h2>History</h2>
                <p>No sooner had Fender revolutionized music with the Telecaster and Precision Bass than it introduced in 1954 what is nearly universally regarded as the archetypal electric guitar, the Stratocaster. Perennially sleek, stylish, smooth playing and tonally versatile, it has transcended its role as musical tool to become nothing short of a cultural icon. There is simply nothing that sings, screams, whispers, moans, roars, rocks and rolls like a Stratocaster.</p>
